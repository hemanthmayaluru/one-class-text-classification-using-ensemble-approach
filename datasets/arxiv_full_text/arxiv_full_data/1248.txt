{"title": "A Deep Convolutional Auto-Encoder with Pooling - Unpooling Layers in  Caffe", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "This paper presents the development of several models of a deep convolutional auto-encoder in the Caffe deep learning framework and their experimental evaluation on the example of MNIST dataset. We have created five models of a convolutional auto-encoder which differ architecturally by the presence or absence of pooling and unpooling layers in the auto-encoder's encoder and decoder parts. Our results show that the developed models provide very good results in dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering tasks, and small classification errors when we used the learned internal code as an input of a supervised linear classifier and multi-layer perceptron. The best results were provided by a model where the encoder part contains convolutional and pooling layers, followed by an analogous decoder part with deconvolution and unpooling layers without the use of switch variables in the decoder part. The paper also discusses practical details of the creation of a deep convolutional auto-encoder in the very popular Caffe deep learning framework. We believe that our approach and results presented in this paper could help other researchers to build efficient deep neural network architectures in the future.", "text": "abstract paper presents

reduction unsupervised clustering? model featured pooling-unpooling layers switches. reached much smaller value cost function provided practically ideal reconstruction input images however fulfilled dimensionality reduction unsupervised clustering tasks worst way. section discuss interesting situation. explanation mentioned zhao paper mnist dataset simple problem model model model similar swwae presented perfect reconstruction mnist images figure zhao stated reason swwae working well fact reconstructing mnist digits overly easy swwae. since mnist roughly binary dataset thus within unpooling stage decoding necessarily demand information ‘what’ reconstruction; i.e. could perfect reconstruction pinning positions indicated ‘where’. therefore believe reconstructing mnist dataset renders insufficient regularization encoding pathway addition statement results show model pooling-unpooling layers without switches decoder part necessarily demand where information successful reconstruction what information. model restores max-pooled features predefined positions unpooled feature maps therefore prevents much self-adapting. centralized unpooling plays role peculiar penalty penalizes sensitivity model input encourages robustness learned representation model reconstruct input image perfectly; however showed best quality dimensionality reduction unsupervised clustering among considered unsupervised models. present alternate explanation model poor dimensionality reduction unsupervised clustering performance. principal difference model considered unsupervised models switch variables considerably increases dimensionality internal representation model model low-dimensional internal code switch variables used reconstruction unsupervised models low-dimensional internal code only. thus model contractive anymore. dimension internal representation much bigger dimension input mnist image model simply learns identity function trivial produces useless uninteresting features; internal code overcomplete corresponds description overcompletness features norouzi following what happens iterations parameter update sampled images become close original ones learning signal disappears. confirmation features model overcomplete fig. last hidden internal code model overcomplete even state-of-the-art t-sne method cannot find appropriate similarity datapoints; barely distinguish clusters digit digit stated sparsity overcomplete code low. specifically zhao stated quotation regularization model insufficient means sparsity low. similarly zeiler calculated relative sparsity feature maps calculated sparsity hidden internal code models used sparsity measure dimensionality number describes sparsity vector analyzed vector smaller threshold means bigger value specifies bigger level sparsity. three experiments three values threshold maximum value analyzed internal code models presented table received similar results thresholds specified average value sparsity threshold three runs table rather specify sparsity number specified percentage elements internal code smaller threshold appropriate internal code. example sparsity model means total elements code within test patterns less maximum value found total elements. allows compare models. note means elements internal relative measure code elements internal code elements internal code. analysis table shown sparsity internal code model less models case interval minimum siamese network maximum model case interval minimum model maximum model case interval minimum model maximum model results show clear relation better sparsity internal code better average per-class classification error state obviously sparsity internal code model less successfully-working models. well-known regularization techniques example dropout weight decay improve sparsity deep models prevent trainable parameters growing large. therefore estimated sparsity trainable parameters researched models using expression approach described above. again threshold successfully-working models shown bigger sparsity model shown lower value overcompleteness model internal representation makes reconstruction overly easy explaining good reconstruction poor clustering performance. complementary explanation arises realize essential function compression finding low-dimensional code represent high-dimensional input low-dimensional information-rich code represents useful clustering data facilitate effective classification. propose switch variables undermine autoencoder’s principal role compressor. illustrate this consider compression ratio achieved model simple approximate compression ratio assume switch variables values uniformly distributed ranges. simple assumption mnist image pixels range requires bytes encode single-precision codes require bytes respectively. switch variables stored model first pooling layer integer address range thus requires least bits encode. switch variables second pooling layer take values range require bits encode. thus model switch variables internal code together total bytes information significantly information stored input image itself giving negative compression ratio switch variables causes model inflate rather compress input data. contrast unsupervised models produce internal codes achieve compression ratios respectively. thorough analysis compression ratio could measure self-information entropy suppose simple calculation sufficiently illustrative. model inflation rather compression input data short-circuits training process normally guides achieve minimal reconstruction error effective compression. extra information cached switch variables allow model achieve good reconstruction training without learning effective compression scheme explains resulting internal codes clustering classification value. experiments relu activation function relu activation function proven better supervised deep machine learning tasks research studies provides better sparsification deep model models sparser coding provide better classification results. useful property relu function serve unsupervised models too. summary different activation functions existing

sparse fully-connected layers models contained value feature maps values cost function training too. initialized weights biases within smaller interval i.e. used <weight_filler {type \"gaussian\" <bias_filler {type \"constant\" value layers models calculated values cost function first training iteration only. first iteration values changed slightly; staying moreless training stopped. opinion
