{"title": "FrameNet CNL: a Knowledge Representation and Information Extraction  Language", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "The paper presents a FrameNet-based information extraction and knowledge representation framework, called FrameNet-CNL. The framework is used on natural language documents and represents the extracted knowledge in a tailor-made Frame-ontology from which unambiguous FrameNet-CNL paraphrase text can be generated automatically in multiple languages. This approach brings together the fields of information extraction and CNL, because a source text can be considered belonging to FrameNet-CNL, if information extraction parser produces the correct knowledge representation as a result. We describe a state-of-the-art information extraction parser used by a national news agency and speculate that FrameNet-CNL eventually could shape the natural language subset used for writing the newswire articles.", "text": "abstract. paper presents framenet-based information extraction knowledge representation framework called framenet-cnl. framework used natural language documents
