{"title": "A Generative Model for Multi-Dialect Representation", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "In the era of deep learning several unsupervised models have been developed to capture the key features in unlabeled handwritten data. Popular among them is the Restricted Boltzmann Machines RBM. However, due to the novelty in handwritten multidialect data, the RBM may fail to generate an efficient representation. In this paper we propose a generative model, the Mode Synthesizing Machine MSM for on-line representation of real life handwritten multidialect language data. The MSM takes advantage of the hierarchical representation of the modes of a data distribution using a two-point error update to learn a sequence of representative multidialects in a generative way. Experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the MSM over the RBM with the former attaining much lower error values than the latter on both independent and mixed data set.", "text": "*corresponding author emmanuel osegi national open university nigeria communication technology department ahmadu bello victoria island lagos nigeria. e-mail ndosegi.com fig. generative model handwritten dialect using msm. notice sharp contrast images. however still easy deduce shape generative model shape original image. fig. generative model handwritten dialect using rbm. notice sharp contrast images. however easy deduce shape generative model shape original image", "year": 2015}
