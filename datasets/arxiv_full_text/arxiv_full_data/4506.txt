{"title": "Universal Algorithmic Intelligence: A mathematical top->down approach", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Sequential decision theory formally solves the problem of rational agents in uncertain worlds if the true environmental prior probability distribution is known. Solomonoff's theory of universal induction formally solves the problem of sequence prediction for unknown prior distribution. We combine both ideas and get a parameter-free theory of universal Artificial Intelligence. We give strong arguments that the resulting AIXI model is the most intelligent unbiased agent possible. We outline how the AIXI model can formally solve a number of problem classes, including sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. The major drawback of the AIXI model is that it is uncomputable. To overcome this problem, we construct a modified algorithm AIXItl that is still effectively more intelligent than any other time t and length l bounded agent. The computation time of AIXItl is of the order t x 2^l. The discussion includes formal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and relations of the AIXI theory to other AI approaches.", "text": "artiﬁcial intelligence; algorithmic probability; sequential decision theory; rational agents; value function; solomonoﬀ induction; kolmogorov complexity; reinforcement learning; universal sequence prediction; strategic games; function minimization; supervised learning. sequential decision theory formally solves problem rational agents uncertain worlds true environmental prior probability distribution known. solomonoﬀ’s theory universal induction formally solves problem sequence prediction unknown prior distribution. combine ideas parameter-free theory universal artiﬁcial intelligence. give strong arguments resulting aixi model intelligent unbiased agent possible. outline aixi model formally solve number problem classes including sequence prediction strategic games function minimization reinforcement supervised learning. major drawback aixi model uncomputable. overcome problem construct modiﬁed algorithm aixitl still eﬀectively intelligent time length bounded agent. cybernetic agent model strings model known deterministic environment model known prior probability probability distributions explicit form model factorizable environments constants limits sequential decision theory introduction algorithmic information theory uncertainty probabilities algorithmic probability universal induction loss bounds pareto optimality time-limited probability distributions idea best vote algorithm extended chronological programs valid approximations eﬀective intelligence order relation", "year": 2007}
