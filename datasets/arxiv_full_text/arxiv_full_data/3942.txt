In this work, we build a formalization of the notion of cooperation and competition of multiple systems working toward a common optimization goal of the population using evolutionary computation techniques. It is justified that evolutionary algorithms are more expressive than conventional recursive algorithms. Three subclasses of evolutionary algorithms are proposed here: bounded finite, unbounded finite and infinite types. Some results on completeness, optimality and search decidability for the above classes are presented. A natural extension of Evolutionary Turing Machine model developed in this paper allows one to mathematically represent and study properties of cooperation and competition in a population of optimized
